      Tiffany enjoys the endless variety she finds working in a busy salon and has a real passion for her work.  With 15 years experience, she takes every opportunity to build upon her education and finds that she can never stop learning and growing in this business.  Healthy hair is her main focus, and she is devoted to making sure that her client's hair is at its best.  She cherishes relationships and the biggest perk of her career is making friends with those who trust her with their hair.
