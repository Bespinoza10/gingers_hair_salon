      Natalie Bryant Quintana is a native of Columbia, TN who grew up watching the women in her family become successful by making people prettier and feel good about themselves.  First her grandmother, then her mother, and now Natalie. <br> <br> These women took their passion and talent for hair and turned it into a career.  Although she has always wanted to be a hairstylist, Natalie attended college and received a degree in Psychology at the University of Tennessee. <br> <br>

With a belief that beauty is in the eye of the beholder-and in a great pair of scissors- Natalie enjoys attending seminars and workshops to learn lessons with classic looks and color combinations to make her clients look chic yet timeless.<br><br>

In her free time, Natalie enjoys serving as a member of Junior Auxiliary and other community organizations, renovating her house, crafting and spending time with friends and family.
